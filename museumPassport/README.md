# Museum Passport

An app to help involve children in museums by giving them interactive questions for each exhibit. The questions are fed from the backend RESTful API written in Rails.

[backend API on heroku](http://museum-passport-backend.herokuapp.com/museums/)    

This app uses Ionic, SASS and Gulp. Tested using Protractor and Karma.
